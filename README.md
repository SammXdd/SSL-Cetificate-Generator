# Self-Signed SSL Certificate and Key Generator

It a python code to generate self-signed SSL certificates and corresponding private keys using the cryptography library. Self-signed certificates are useful for setting up secure connections in local development environments or for testing purposes.


## Features
- Perfect for setting up secure connections on your computer while you are building or testing websites.

- You dont have to go through a formal process or pay for certificates. These are self-signed, meaning they are good for testing but not for real websites.

## Usage

`$ git clone https://github.com/SammXdd/SSL-Cetificate-Generator`

`$ pip install cryptography`

`$ python enc-ssl.py`


<br>
#### These certificates are for testing only, not for real websites. For live sites, you will need certificates from trusted sources.
